Arthur's idea wall

Next Generation App designing  principle:  Principleof LOVE(Less Of View, Eco for our sense).
I am strongly aware and sure that the future app have 2 deviations: One is toward the  virtual reality to make people feels the apps as a real nature; One is the apps you can not feel: an app have no view, user need not to see or touch, and even not need to  speak to the app.
As More and more people aware that to watch the screen is a tired work, Because We have already see too much. Aware that seeing the screen long time is a wast of time, we need to see the real landscape as forests and lakes, not screen. We need the app free our Nervous System----the eco App for our sense: the Second method will be the eco way for future:
The Method:
1,Make an App less of its Views, 
2,Using voice control instead of touch. (keep the touch function for user have voice problem), Then
3,Intelligent Input system:  control the Device  by sensors, by algorithms.  As less as the user need to do as possible!
